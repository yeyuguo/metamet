# Format: 
# PARTNAME [RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS [RETRY_TIMES [WAIT_RETRY_TIMES]]]
# if PARTNAME starts with '/', it means absolute path to the run root dir.
# else, it means relative path of the current part.
#
# e.g.
# /PART1/PART1_1 30 3 100
# means this part requires part "/PART1/PART1_1" to be run first. 
#
# if it hasn't been run successfully yet, 
# try to run it with at most 3 tries, 30 seconds interval.
#
# if it's being run by another run, wait for it to end. 
# while waiting, recheck whether it's finished every 30 seconds, 
# with 100 tries at most.
