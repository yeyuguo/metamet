This is a collection of shell utils.

Introduction

Every script will print usage when called with no args, except for check_file_size, which shows usage with -h or --help.

Datetime:
	g2j:
		convert CCYYMMDD to CCYYJJJ
	
	j2g:
		convert CCYYJJJ to CCYY MM DD
		
	j2g_no_space:
		convert CCYYJJJ to CCYYMMDD
	
	gday_change:
		gday_change CCYYMMDD {+/-}N days
		e.g. gday_change 20100829 -1000 -> 20071203

	jday_change:
		jday_change CCYYJJJ {+/-}N days
		e.g. jday_change 2010364 5 -> 2011004
		e.g. jday_change 2010001 -3 -> 2009363
	
Repeat or wait:

	TRY_N_TIMES:
		Repeat some command several times until the command succeeds.

	WAIT_FOR:
		Wait for some condition before running a command.

	WAIT_FILE:
		Another version of WAIT_FOR. 
		Wait for some file to appear before running a command.

Misc:
	check_file_size:
		Checking file sizes easily. 
		See its usage with -h or --help.

	rangefmt:
		Generate a series of numbers with BEGIN:END:STEP in a certain format. 
		No need to use cshell's clumsy arithmetics in a while loop.
		Use foreach ( `rangefmt ...` ) instead.
		e.g.
		rangefmt 0:72:6 "%02d"  will generate:
			00 06 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 66 72

	arangefmt:
		like rangefmt, but can handle float number. requires python-numpy.
